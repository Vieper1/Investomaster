# Hackathon objectives (for reference)
### Purpose
Assist users to monitor and judge the stock market, thereby allowing them to make decisions for smart investments.

### Must have Functionalities
1. The application should numerically represent previous and current stock prices and should account for any slightest
stock movement. The UI design and underlying logic is left to the team’s discretion.
2. Each stock should have a graphical representation starting from any previous customizable date to current date.
3. Users should be able to categorize any stocks of their choice as ‘Favourites’.
4. Users must be able to set an upper and lower ‘watch-point’ on the stocks and should be thereby notified if the stock
crosses the watch-point.
5. Have a customizable setting of automatic data refresh time period. Additionally, users should also be able to refresh the
content manually.

### Good to have Functionalities
1. Predicting movement of stocks and notifying the same
2. Users can also have access to monitor other financial instruments like Futures, options, FOREX, commodities, etc.
3. Any news which might impact the stock market should be notified to the users.
4. Ticker scroll at the bottom of each page to depict upward or downward movement of stocks.
5. An option should be made available so as to aid users to compare more than one stock.
6. The application should distinguish instruments/indices belonging to different stock exchanges.
